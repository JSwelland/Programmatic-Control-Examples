Original Attribution: Carl M - Tektronix Applications

This example demonstrates how to establish simultaneous connections to two LE320 units.

LE API is a proprietary WIN32COM module included with the control software; https://www.tek.com/bit-error-rate-tester/le320-software-0
Note: the win32com module is 32-bit only, your custom application must be a 32-bit applications. 64-bit Windows will still execute 32-bit applications.

Change the logging level to DEBUG for increased verbosity.
